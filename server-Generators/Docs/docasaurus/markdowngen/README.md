# DocFxMarkdownGen

Generates documentation for a .NET library in Markdown intended for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) using [docfx](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx).

## Installation

```sh
dotnet tool install -g DocFxMarkdownGen
# now installed as "dfmg", use with "dotnet dfmg" or just "dfmg" if tools are in PATH
```

## Usage

By default dfmg takes it's config from `config.yaml`, you can override the file using the `DFMG_CONFIG` environment variable.

```yaml
outputPath: /home/jan/whatever/docs/api
yamlPath: /home/jan/gen/api
```

- `outputPath` is the path where the generated documentation will be placed, it is always wiped.
- `yamlPath` is the path where the `.yml` files generated by `docfx metadata` are placed, probably the `api` directory where your `docfx.json` file is.
- `indexSlug` is the slug of the index page, defaults to `/api`.

## Example sites

- [`examples/discord-net-dfmg`](https://discord-net-dfmg.jan0660.dev/api): example site done on [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net)
- [Log73](https://latest-log73.jan0660.dev/api)
