Each site is represented in JSON as a hash mapping to the following keys and values:

- `shortcuts`: an array of shortcuts which are used for generating URLs. Required.
- `name`: a displayable name for the particular developer portal. Required.
- `url`: the URL to redirect to. Required.
- `sortKey`: a key to sort on for display in the directory. If not present, the `name` will be used. Optional.
